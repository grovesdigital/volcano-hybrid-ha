## üéØ **Features & Functionality**

### Q: What entities does the integration create?
**A:** The integration creates:
- **1 Climate entity**: Temperature control and heating
- **1 Fan entity**: Fan control with timer
- **2 Number entities**: Fan timer and screen brightness
- **10+ Sensor entities**: Temperature, status, and statistics
- **0 Button entities**: Following building blocks philosophy

### Q: Why are there no built-in preset temperature buttons?
**A:** By design! The integration follows a **building blocks philosophy**:
- Different users want different temperatures
- Button workflows vary significantly
- You can easily create your own preset buttons using input helpers
- Maximum flexibility for custom automation

See [Automation Examples](Automation-Examples) for creating custom presets.

### Q: How often does the integration update sensor data?
**A:** The integration uses **dynamic update intervals**:
- **1 second**: During fan operation or approaching target temperature
- **2 seconds**: When actively heating
- **3 seconds**: When cooling down
- **5 seconds**: When idle/cold
- **10 minutes**: Device information (firmware, serial number)

### Q: What's the difference between session tracking and operation time?
**A:** 
- **Session tracking**: Counts user sessions (heating cycles) with start/end times
- **Operation time**: Total device runtime from the Volcano's internal counter
- **Sessions today**: Resets daily at midnight
- **Total sessions**: Lifetime counter since integration installed
- **Operation time**: Hardware counter, never resets

## ü§ñ **Automation & Events**

### Q: What events does the integration fire?
**A:** The integration fires `volcano_session_event` with these types:
- `session_started`: Heating begins
- `temperature_reached`: Target temperature achieved  
- `fan_started`: Fan turned on
- `fan_stopped`: Fan turned off
- `session_ended`: Session complete (cooling down)

Each event includes rich data like temperatures, durations, and session counts.

### Q: Can I build my own automation workflows?
**A:** Absolutely! That's the whole point. The integration provides:
- **Rich sensor data** for decision making
- **Comprehensive events** for automation triggers
- **Flexible controls** for device operation
- **Professional documentation** with examples

See [Automation Examples](Automation-Examples) and [Building Blocks](Building-Blocks).

### Q: How do I create temperature preset buttons?
**A:** Use input button helpers:
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
input_button:
  volcano_preset_190:
    name: "Volcano 190¬∞C"
    icon: mdi:thermometer

# automation
automation:
  - alias: "Volcano 190¬∞C Preset"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_button.volcano_preset_190
    action:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.volcano_hybrid
        data:
          temperature: 190
```

### Q: Can I schedule automatic sessions?
**A:** Yes! Use time-based automations:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Evening Session"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "20:00:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.volcano_hybrid
        data:
          temperature: 190
      - service: climate.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: climate.volcano_hybrid
```

## üìä **Statistics & Monitoring**

### Q: How accurate is session detection?
**A:** Very accurate with these criteria:
- **Session start**: Temperature rises from <50¬∞C to >100¬∞C
- **Session end**: Temperature drops below 60¬∞C or heating turned off
- **Minimum duration**: 60 seconds to filter false positives
- **Manual override**: Heating on/off also triggers session events

### Q: Why is my session count different from what I expect?
**A:** Common reasons:
- **False starts**: Brief heating that doesn't reach temperature
- **Multiple cycles**: Heating on/off multiple times counts as separate sessions
- **Timing**: Sessions are counted when they actually start, not when planned
- **Reset timing**: Daily counter resets at midnight system time

### Q: Can I export session data for analysis?
**A:** Yes, several ways:
- **Home Assistant history**: Built-in statistics tracking
- **Event logging**: Capture events to files or external systems
- **CSV export**: Create automations that log to CSV files
- **Database**: HA stores all data in SQLite/PostgreSQL

### Q: How far back does statistics data go?
**A:** Depends on setup:
- **Sensor states**: HA's default retention (10 days history, 10 days statistics)
- **Long-term statistics**: Can be kept indefinitely
- **Event data**: Stored in HA database with same retention
- **Custom logging**: You control retention with your automations

## üîå **Connection & Performance**

### Q: Why does the connection drop sometimes?
**A:** Common causes and solutions:
- **Range**: Move HA host closer to Volcano
- **Interference**: Reduce WiFi/microwave interference
- **Power saving**: Disable USB power management on Linux
- **Multiple connections**: Only connect from one device at a time
- **Device sleep**: Volcano may sleep after inactivity

### Q: Can I connect multiple Home Assistant instances?
**A:** No, the Volcano can only maintain one Bluetooth connection at a time. Multiple HA instances will conflict.

### Q: Does the integration work with Volcano through WiFi?
**A:** No, the Volcano Hybrid only supports Bluetooth LE connectivity. There's no WiFi option.

### Q: Why is the integration slow to respond sometimes?
**A:** Performance factors:
- **Update intervals**: Integration automatically optimizes based on activity
- **Bluetooth latency**: BLE has inherent latency (1-2 seconds normal)
- **HA performance**: Check overall HA system performance
- **Distance**: Bluetooth range affects response time

### Q: Can I use this with other Bluetooth devices simultaneously?
**A:** Yes, the integration shares Bluetooth properly. However:
- Don't connect other apps to the Volcano simultaneously
- Heavy Bluetooth traffic may slow responses
- USB Bluetooth adapters generally handle multiple devices better

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**
